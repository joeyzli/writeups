Now, comrades(2), what is the nature of this life of(10) ours? Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies(40), and those of us who(45) are capable of it are forced to work to the(55) last atom(57) of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has(68) come to an end we are slaughtered(75) with hideous cruelty. No animal in England knows the meaning of happiness or leisure(89) after he is a year(94) old. No animal in England is free. The life of an animal(106) is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth(115).
