His mind slid away into(5) the labyrinthine world of doublethink(10). To know and not to know, to be conscious of(20) complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies(27), to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory(40) and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate(53) morality while laying claim to it, to(60) believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget(76), whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw(85) it back into memory(89) again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly(100) to forget it again(104), and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself that was the ultimate(120) subtlety; consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis(137) you had just(140) performed. Even to understand the word 'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink(152).
