## Solution

Decoding from binary, this looks like garbage data. My first thought is XOR, and I assume the plaintext is the flag, so I crib drag.
The key appears to be `gaia`. It's at this point that I realize that the key was in the challenge description. Whoops.

We XOR with the key `gaia` and get the flag.
