# flagCTF â€“ Encoding is not Encryption

* **Category:** Crypto
* **Points:** 20

## Challenge

> Encoding is not encryption; however, these amateur cryptographers decided to encode their secret many times and keep the order of the algorithms that they used to themselves, thinking that would keep the secret. You managed to recover the program that they use, but not the input or output. Can you recover the original secret text? Submit it as the flag.

## Solution

We download the file and check it's contents:

```
Add later, can't find file right now.
```

I'll put exact order later, but it was a combination of base32, base64, and hex.

```
Let us encode just one more time, and then we will stop.
