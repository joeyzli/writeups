I went over to my window and opened it and(10) packed a snowball with my(15) bare hands. The snow was very good for packing. I didn't throw it at anything(30), though. I started to throw it. At a car that was parked across the street. But I changed my mind(50). The car looked so nice(55) and white. Then I started to throw(62) it at a hydrant, but that looked too nice and white(73), too. Finally I didn't throw it at anything. All I did was close the window and walk around(91) the room with the snowball, packing it harder. A little while later, I still had(106) it with me when I and Brossard(113) and Ackley got on the bus. The bus driver opened the doors(125) and made me throw it out. I told him I wasn't going to chuck it at anybody, but he wouldn't believe me(147). People never believe you(151).
